# 1.5 — `std::cout`, `std::cin`, and `std::endl`

In this lesson, we’ll expand on:

- `std::cout` (output to console)
    
- `std::cin` (input from keyboard)
    
- `std::endl` and `\n` (newlines)
    

These come from the **input/output library**.

---

# The input/output library

The I/O library is part of the C++ standard library and handles:

- Keyboard input
    
- Console output
    

To use it, include:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

The `io` in `iostream` stands for **input/output**.

---

# `std::cout` — Character output

`std::cout` lets us print text or values to the console.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!";
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Printing numbers

```cpp
std::cout << 4;
```

Output:

```
4
```

---

## Printing variables

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{5};
    std::cout << x;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
5
```

---

# The insertion operator `<<`

The `<<` operator sends data **to** `std::cout`.

Think of it like a conveyor belt:

```
value  ----->  std::cout
```

You can chain multiple outputs:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
```

Output:

```
Hello world!
```

---

## Mixing text and variables

```cpp
int x{5};
std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x;
```

Output:

```
x is equal to: 5
```

---

# Newlines

Separate `std::cout` statements do NOT create new lines automatically.

Example:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hi!";
std::cout << "My name is Alex.";
```

Output:

```
Hi!My name is Alex.
```

---

# `std::endl`

To move to the next line:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl;
```

This:

1. Inserts a newline
    
2. Flushes the output buffer
    

---

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
Hi!
My name is Alex.
```

---

## Best practice

Output a newline when a line of output is complete.

But…

---

# `std::cout` is buffered

Output is usually:

1. Stored in memory (buffer)
    
2. Sent to console later (flushed)
    

Flushing is slow.

`std::endl` forces a flush every time.

---

# `\n` vs `std::endl`

Better option:

```
'\n'
```

This:

- Inserts a newline
    
- Does NOT flush the buffer
    
- Is faster
    

---

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{5};

    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n';
    std::cout << "Yep.\n";
    std::cout << "Done!\n";

    return 0;
}
```

---

## Best practice

Prefer `\n` over `std::endl`.

---

## ⚠ Warning

Use a backslash:

```
'\n'
```

NOT:

```
'/n'   // wrong
```

---

# `std::cin` — Character input

`std::cin` reads input from keyboard.

It uses the extraction operator:

```
>>
```

---

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";

    int x{};
    std::cin >> x;

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

If user enters:

```
4
```

Output:

```
You entered 4
```

---

## Extraction operator `>>`

Data flows:

```
keyboard  ----->  std::cin  ----->  variable
```

Example:

```cpp
std::cin >> x;
```

---

# Reading multiple values

```cpp
int x{};
int y{};
std::cin >> x >> y;
```

If user types:

```
5 6
```

Then:

- `x = 5`
    
- `y = 6`
    

---

# `std::cin` is buffered

Input also happens in stages:

1. User types → stored in input buffer
    
2. `>>` extracts from buffer
    

Input is processed in **FIFO** order  
(First In, First Out)

---

## Example behavior

Program:

```cpp
int x{};
std::cin >> x;

int y{};
std::cin >> y;
```

If user enters:

```
4 5
```

Then:

- `x` gets `4`
    
- `y` gets `5`
    
- No second prompt needed
    

Because `5` was already in the buffer.

---

# How extraction works (simplified)

When `std::cin >> x` runs:

1. If stream is in bad state → stop
    
2. Leading whitespace removed
    
3. If buffer empty → wait for input
    
4. Extract valid characters
    

---

## Extraction results

- If valid characters extracted → success
    
- If none extracted → failure
    
- On failure:
    
    - Variable set to 0 (since C++11)
        
    - Future extractions fail until cleared
        

---

# Common input cases

Assume:

```cpp
int x{};
std::cin >> x;
```

---

## a) Letter input: `h`

Result:

```
0
```

Extraction fails.

---

## b) Fraction: `3.7`

Result:

```
3
```

Extraction stops at `.`

---

## c) Negative number: `-3`

Result:

```
-3
```

Minus sign allowed.

---

## d) Word: `Hello`

Result:

```
0
```

Extraction fails.

---

## e) Very large number

Result:

Likely:

```
2147483647
```

Value clamped to max `int`.

---

## f) `123abc`

Result:

```
123
```

Stops at first invalid character.

---

## g) `abc123`

Result:

```
0
```

Fails immediately.

---

## h) `" +5"`

Result:

```
5
```

Leading spaces ignored.

---

## i) `5b6`

Result:

```
5
```

Stops at `b`.

---

# Remember the rule

- `std::cout` → output
    
- `std::cin` → input
    
- `<<` → goes to console
    
- `>>` → goes into variable
    

---

# Example: Three inputs

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Asks the user to enter three values and prints them as a sentence.
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter three numbers: ";

    int x{};
    int y{};
    int z{};

    std::cin >> x >> y >> z;

    std::cout << "You entered "
              << x << ", "
              << y << ", and "
              << z << ".\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Input:

```
4 5 6
```

Output:

```
You entered 4, 5, and 6.
```
