# 2.1 — Introduction to functions

---

# Updated Definition

A **function** is:

> A reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.

Functions help break large programs into smaller, manageable pieces.

---

# Why Functions Matter

As programs grow:

- Putting everything inside `main()` becomes messy
    
- Harder to test
    
- Harder to read
    
- Harder to maintain
    

Functions allow:

- Modularity
    
- Reusability
    
- Better organization
    
- Easier debugging
    

---

# main()

Every C++ program must have:

```cpp
int main()
```

Execution always begins in `main()`.

---

# Function Calls (The “Bookmark” Model)

When a function is called:

1. Current function pauses
    
2. CPU jumps to called function
    
3. Called function executes
    
4. Control returns to caller
    
5. Execution resumes where it left off
    

Like placing a bookmark in a book.

---

# Terminology

- **Caller** → the function making the call
    
- **Callee** → the function being called
    
- **Function call** = invocation
    

Example:

```cpp
doPrint();
```

---

# Basic Function Syntax

```cpp
returnType functionName()
{
    // function body
}
```

### Parts:

- **Return type** → `int` or `void` (for now)
    
- **Function name** → identifier
    
- **Parentheses ()** → required
    
- **Function body** → statements inside `{}`
    

---

# Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doPrint()
{
    std::cout << "In doPrint()\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
    doPrint();
    std::cout << "Ending main()\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### Output:

```
Starting main()
In doPrint()
Ending main()
```

---

# Important Rule

You must define a function before calling it  
(for now — forward declarations come later).

---

# Don’t Forget the Parentheses

This:

```cpp
doPrint;
```

is NOT a function call.

This:

```cpp
doPrint();
```

is.

---

# Functions Can Be Called Multiple Times

```cpp
doPrint();
doPrint();
```

Each call runs the function again.

Functions are reusable by design.

---

# Functions Can Call Other Functions

Call chain example:

```
main()
  └── doA()
        └── doB()
```

Execution flows down and back up.

Example output:

```
Starting main()
Starting doA()
In doB()
Ending doA()
Ending main()
```

This demonstrates:

- Nested calls (call hierarchy)
    
- Return to caller after completion
    

---

# Nested Functions (Not Allowed)

This is illegal in C++:

```cpp
int main()
{
    void foo() { } // ❌ Not allowed
}
```

C++ does not allow functions defined inside other functions.

Correct version:

```cpp
void foo() { }

int main()
{
    foo();
}
```

---

# Placeholder Names

Common meaningless names used in examples:

- `foo`
    
- `bar`
    
- `baz`
    
- `goo`, `moo`, `boo`
    

These are called **metasyntactic variables** (placeholder names).

---

# Quiz Review

---

## Q1

The curly braces and statements inside a function definition are called:

> The **function body**

---

## Q2 — Trace the Program

Given:

```cpp
main()
  → doA()
        → doB()
  → doB()
```

Execution order:

```
Starting main()
In doA()
In doB()
In doB()
Ending main()
```

Explanation:

1. main() starts
    
2. doA() called
    
3. doA() calls doB()
    
4. doA() ends
    
5. main() calls doB() again
    
6. main() ends

# Key Takeaways

- Functions allow modular program structure
    
- `main()` is required entry point
    
- Functions pause caller, execute, then return
    
- Functions must be defined before use (for now)
    
- Parentheses are required when calling
    
- Functions can call other functions
    
- C++ does not support nested function definitions
    

---

# Big Picture

Functions are the foundation of structured programming in C++.

Without them:

- Programs don’t scale
    
- Code becomes unmanageable
    
- Reuse becomes impossible
    

Everything beyond this chapter builds on understanding how functions organize execution flow.
