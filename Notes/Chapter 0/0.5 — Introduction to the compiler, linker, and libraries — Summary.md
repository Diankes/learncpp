## 0.5 — Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries — Concise Summary

This lesson explains steps 4–7 of the software development process: compiling, linking, testing, and debugging.

### Step 4: Compilation

A **compiler** processes each `.cpp` file individually and performs two tasks:

1. **Checks for syntax errors**  
   - Ensures the code follows C++ rules.  
   - Stops and reports errors (with line numbers) if violations are found.

2. **Translates source code into machine instructions**  
   - Produces an intermediate **object file** (`.o` or `.obj`).  
   - Object files contain machine code plus additional data needed for linking and debugging.

Each source file generates one object file.

### Step 5: Linking

After successful compilation, the **linker**:

1. Verifies object files are valid.
2. Resolves cross-file dependencies  
   - Connects references in one file to definitions in another.  
   - Missing definitions produce linker errors.
3. Links required libraries (precompiled reusable code).
4. Produces the final output (typically an executable).

If linking fails, an error is generated and the process stops.

### The C++ Standard Library

- C++ includes the **C++ Standard Library**.
- Provides commonly used functionality.
- The Input/Output library (`iostream`) is widely used.
- Most programs link the standard library automatically.

---

### Third-Party Libraries

- Libraries created by external developers.
- Provide additional functionality not included in the standard library.
- Example: sound playback functionality.
- Linked during the linking step.

---

### Building

**Building** refers to the full process of:
- Compiling source files
- Linking object files and libraries
- Producing an executable

The resulting executable is sometimes called a **build**.

---

### Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging

- **Testing**: Running the program to verify correct behavior.
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors when behavior is incorrect.

These steps often repeat as part of development.

### IDEs

Steps 3–5 and 7 require tools:
- Editor
- Compiler
- Linker
- Debugger

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** combines these tools into one application.
