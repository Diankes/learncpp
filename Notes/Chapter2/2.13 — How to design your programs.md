# 2.13 — How to design your programs

This lesson is a breath of fresh air because it addresses the "blank screen syndrome" that hits every new programmer. You're absolutely right to value this—most beginners jump straight into typing code, only to realize halfway through that they've built a "house" with no front door.

Here is the summary of the **LearnCpp guide to program design**.

### **The Golden Rule: Design Before Coding**

Programming is like architecture. If you build without a plan, you’ll spend more time fixing structural leaks than actually living in the house. A little planning up front prevents massive frustration later.

### **Phase 1: The Design Process**

#### **1. Define Your Goal**

State what the program does in one or two sentences. Focus on the **user-facing outcome**.

- _Example:_ "A program that calculates how long it takes a ball to hit the ground from a specific height."
    

#### **2. Define Requirements**

List the constraints (time, memory) and capabilities (what the program _must_ do).

- Focus on the **"what,"** not the **"how."** * _Requirement:_ "The user must be able to enter the height in meters."
    

#### **3. Tools and Backups**

Decide on your OS, IDE, and—most importantly—your **backup strategy**.

- **Pro Tip:** If your code only exists on one drive, it doesn't exist. Use GitHub, Dropbox, or even email it to yourself.
    

#### **4. Break It Down (Decomposition)**

This is the "Top-Down" method. Take a complex task and break it into sub-tasks until each task is trivial.

- **Clean House** $\rightarrow$ Vacuum, Clean Bathrooms, Clean Kitchen.
    
- **Clean Kitchen** $\rightarrow$ Clear counters, Scrub sink, Take out trash.
    

> **Key Insight:** These sub-tasks eventually become your **functions**.

#### **5. Sequence the Events**

Determine the order. For a calculator, it’s: Get #1 $\rightarrow$ Get Op $\rightarrow$ Get #2 $\rightarrow$ Calculate $\rightarrow$ Print.

### **Phase 2: The Implementation Process**

#### **Step 1: Outline `main()`**

Write your `main()` function using comments or "stubs" (empty functions) for the tasks you identified in the sequencing phase.

#### **Step 2: The "Write-and-Test" Cycle**

Don't write the whole program at once.

1. Write **one** function.
    
2. **Test** that function immediately (use temporary `std::cout` statements to verify values).
    
3. Once it works, move to the next.
    

#### **Step 3: Final Testing**

Once all pieces work together, test the program as a whole.

### **Authoritative Advice for Longevity**

- **Keep it Simple (KISS):** Don't try to build an RPG on day one. Build a program that displays a grid first.
    
- **Feature Creep is Real:** Add features incrementally. Get the core working, then add the "bells and whistles."
    
- **Maintainability > Performance:** As Donald Knuth famously said, _"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."_ Don't worry about making the code fast yet; make it readable and organized.
    
- **Don't Polish Early:** Don't spend hours documenting or perfecting a feature that might get deleted in the next draft. Get it "good enough" and move on.
