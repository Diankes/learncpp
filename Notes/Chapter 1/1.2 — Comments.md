# 1.2 — Comments

## What is a comment?

A **comment** is a programmer-readable note inserted into source code.

* Comments are ignored by the compiler.
* They exist only to help programmers understand the code.
* They do not affect how the program runs.

---

# Types of comments in C++

C++ supports two styles of comments.

## 1. Single-line comments

Begin with:

```cpp
//
```

Everything from `//` to the end of the line is ignored.

Example:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!"; // prints a message
```

Single-line comments are typically used for:

* Brief explanations
* Commenting out individual lines of code

They can be placed:

* At the end of a line (if short)
* Above the line (preferred for long lines)

---

## 2. Multi-line comments

Begin with:

```cpp
/*
```

End with:

```cpp
*/
```

Everything between them is ignored.

Example:

```cpp
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

Important rule:

Multi-line comments **cannot be nested**.

Using one multi-line comment inside another will cause errors.

# Proper use of comments

Comments should serve three main purposes:

## 1. Describe what (high-level)

At the top of a program, library, or function:

* What does this program do?
* What does this function accomplish?

Example:

```cpp
// Calculates the student's final grade
```

---

## 2. Describe how (structure-level)

Inside a function:

* How does the code achieve its goal?

Example:

```cpp
// 1) Collect input
// 2) Calculate average
// 3) Return result
```

---

## 3. Describe why (statement-level)

At the statement level, comments should explain **why**, not what.

Bad comment:

```cpp
// Set sight to 0
sight = 0;
```

Good comment:

```cpp
// Player drank a blindness potion
sight = 0;
```

The code already shows what is happening. The comment should explain the reasoning.

---

# Best practice

* Comment your code clearly and liberally.
* Write comments as if the reader has no prior knowledge.
* Do not assume you will remember your reasoning later.

---

# Commenting out code

Commenting out code means temporarily turning code into comments so it does not compile or execute.

Example (single line):

```cpp
// std::cout << 1;
```

Example (multiple lines):

```cpp
/*
std::cout << 1;
std::cout << 2;
std::cout << 3;
*/
```

---

## Why comment out code?

* Code doesn’t compile yet
* Code compiles but behaves incorrectly
* Debugging to isolate a problem
* Temporarily replacing old code with new code

---

## VS Code shortcut

To comment or uncomment selected lines:

```
Ctrl + /
```

---

# Additional notes

* If you use single-line comments for documentation, multi-line comments are convenient for commenting out blocks.
* Multi-line comments inside other multi-line comments will cause errors.
* Professional tools such as documentation generators (e.g., Doxygen) can help standardize and export documentation.

---

# Final summary

* Comments are ignored by the compiler.
* Use `//` for single-line comments.
* Use `/* */` for multi-line comments.
* At high level: explain what.
* Inside functions: explain how.
* At statement level: explain why.
* Comment out code to debug or test safely.
