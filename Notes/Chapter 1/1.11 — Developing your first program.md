# 1.11 — Developing your first program

This lesson walks through building your first complete C++ program step by step:

> Ask the user for an integer, then print double that number.

---

# Goal

Example output (user enters `4`):

```
Enter an integer: 4
Double that number is: 8
```

---

# Best practice: Build incrementally

Do **not** write everything at once.

Instead:

1. Add a small piece
    
2. Compile
    
3. Test
    
4. Repeat
    

This makes debugging much easier.

---

# Step 1 — Basic structure

Every C++ program needs `main()`:

```cpp
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Step 2 — Include iostream

We need:

- `std::cout` (output)
    
- `std::cin` (input)
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

---

# Step 3 — Prompt the user

```cpp
std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
```

At this point, the program prints the message and exits.

---

# Step 4 — Get user input

We must:

1. Create a variable
    
2. Use `std::cin` with `>>`
    

Incorrect version (common mistake):

```cpp
std::cin << num;   // ❌ wrong operator
```

Correct version:

```cpp
int num{};
std::cin >> num;   // ✅ extraction operator
```

Key lesson:

- `<<` → output (std::cout)
    
- `>>` → input (std::cin)
    

---

# Step 5 — Double the number

There are three approaches.

---

## ❌ Worst solution (avoid)

```cpp
num = num * 2;
std::cout << num;
```

Why bad?

- Overwrites original input
    
- Confusing
    
- You lose the original value
    

---

## ⚠️ Better solution

```cpp
int doubleNum{ num * 2 };
std::cout << doubleNum;
```

Better because:

- Keeps original value
    
- Clearer
    

Downside:

- Extra variable used once
    

---

## ✅ Preferred solution

```cpp
std::cout << "Double that number is: " << num * 2 << '\n';
```

Why best?

- No unnecessary variable
    
- Doesn’t overwrite input
    
- Clean and readable
    
- Uses expression directly where needed
    

This is the reference solution.

---

# Final reference program

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

    int num{};
    std::cin >> num;

    std::cout << "Double that number is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

---

# Extended version (Double + Triple)

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

    int num{};
    std::cin >> num;

    std::cout << "Double " << num << " is: " << num * 2 << '\n';
    std::cout << "Triple " << num << " is: " << num * 3 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

# Important programming lessons

### 1️⃣ Make it work first

A working program is the priority.

### 2️⃣ Then improve it

After it works:

- Clean up debugging code
    
- Improve readability
    
- Simplify logic
    
- Follow best practices
    

### 3️⃣ Optimization ≠ performance first

New programmers focus too much on speed.

You should optimize for:

- Readability
    
- Maintainability
    
- Simplicity
    

---

# Key mindset shift

You will not write perfect code on the first try.

Programming is:

> Write → Test → Improve → Refine → Simplify

Iteration is normal.

---

# Memorization?

You don’t memorize everything.

C++ is:

- 1 part knowing concepts
    
- 2 parts looking things up
    

Focus on understanding what’s possible — not memorizing every detail.

---

# Core takeaways from Chapter 1

- Use incremental development
    
- Understand input/output operators
    
- Use expressions directly when appropriate
    
- Avoid unnecessary variables
    
- Don’t overwrite important data
    
- Refactor after it works
    

---

You now understand enough to:

- Build a basic C++ program
    
- Use variables
    
- Use expressions
    
- Get user input
    
- Produce formatted output
    

This is your first real step into structured C++ development.
