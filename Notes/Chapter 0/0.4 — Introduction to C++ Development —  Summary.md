## 0.4 — Introduction to C++ Development —  Summary

This lesson explains the overall C++ software development process (steps 1–3 in detail, 4–7 previewed).

## The Software Development Process

### Step 1: Define the problem (The “What”)

Clearly state what you want the program to do.

Examples:

- Calculate the average of numbers.
    
- Generate and navigate a maze.
    
- Analyze stock price data.
    

A well-defined problem is necessary before proceeding.

### Step 2: Design a solution (The “How”)

Plan how to solve the problem before coding.

Good solutions are:

- Simple and clear
    
- Well documented (assumptions and limitations stated)
    
- Modular (parts reusable or changeable independently)
    
- Able to handle unexpected situations gracefully
    

Skipping design and coding immediately often leads to:

- Fragile programs
    
- Hard-to-maintain code
    
- Bugs (programming errors)
    

Important insight:  
Most development time (60–90%) is spent on maintenance, debugging, and improvements—not initial coding. Good planning saves time long term.

### Step 3: Write the program

To write a program, you need:

1. Knowledge of C++
    
2. A text editor (preferably a code editor)
    

The written instructions are called **source code**.

Example structure of a simple C++ program:

- `#include <iostream>`
    
- `int main()`
    
- Output using `std::cout`
    
- `return 0;`

## Why Use a Code Editor?

A proper code editor provides:

- **Line numbers** (helps locate compiler errors)
    
- **Syntax highlighting** (makes code easier to read)
    
- **Monospace font** (distinguishes similar characters like 0/O, 1/l/I)
    

These features improve clarity and reduce mistakes.

---

## Source Files

- C++ programs may have one or many source files.
    
- Each source file must be saved to disk.
    
- Common extension: `.cpp`
    
- De facto standard: name the primary file `main.cpp`.
    

Other possible extensions: `.cc`, `.cxx`.

Best practice:  
Name the primary source file `main.cpp`.

### Next Steps

After writing source code:

- Compile it
    
- Link it
    
- Test it
    
- Debug it
    

These steps are covered in the next lesson.
