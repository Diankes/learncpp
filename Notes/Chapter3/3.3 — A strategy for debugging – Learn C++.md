# 3.3 — A strategy for debugging – Learn C++
### **1. Code Inspection**

In small programs, you can often "eye-ball" the code to find a bug.

- **When it works:** If you have a clear symptom (e.g., names are sorted backwards), you can look directly at the relevant function (`sortNames()`).
    
- **The Problem:** In large programs, inspection fails because there is too much code, the logic is too complex, or you are blinded by **bad assumptions** (you see what you _think_ you wrote rather than what is actually there).
    

### **2. Reproducing the Problem**

Before you can fix a bug, you **must** be able to make it happen consistently.

- **Goal:** Create a set of "reproduction steps"—a clear list of actions or inputs that trigger the bug every time.
    
- **Why?** If a bug only happens 10% of the time, you will waste 90% of your time running code that doesn't tell you anything. 100% reproducibility is the ideal starting point for any investigation.
    

### **3. The "Hi-Lo" Strategy (Homing In)**

If you can't see the bug, you have to "home in" on it by watching the program run. This is similar to a number-guessing game where each guess tells you if the target is higher or lower.

- **"Too Low" (The problem is further down):** If you can prove the program state is perfectly correct at a certain point, you know the bug must occur somewhere **after** that point.
    
- **"Too High" (The problem is further back):** If you notice a variable has an incorrect value or the program crashes at a specific line, the bug must have occurred **at or before** that point.
    

### **The Systematic Process**

Instead of guessing randomly, follow this loop:

1. **Reproduce:** Make the bug appear.
    
2. **Gather Info:** Check variables or program state at a specific point.
    
3. **Narrow the Search:** Use that info to rule out chunks of code (the "Hi-Lo" method).
    
4. **Repeat:** Keep narrowing the range until you isolate the single line causing the issue.
