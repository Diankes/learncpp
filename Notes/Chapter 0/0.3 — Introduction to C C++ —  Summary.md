## 0.3 — Introduction to C/C++ — Concise Summary

This lesson provides historical background on C and C++, their evolution, philosophy, and typical use cases.

### The C Language

- Developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
    
- Designed as a systems programming language (primarily for operating systems).
    
- Goals:
    
    - Minimalistic
        
    - Efficient
        
    - Portable
        
    - Direct memory access
        
    - Self-contained
        

In 1973, Unix was largely rewritten in C, which increased C’s popularity due to its portability compared to assembly.

Key milestones:

- 1978: “The C Programming Language” (K&R) became a de facto standard.
    
- 1989: ANSI standardized C (C89).
    
- 1990: ISO adopted it as C90.
    
- 1999: ISO released C99 with additional features.

### C++

- Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 as an extension of C.
    
- Adds many features, most notably support for object-oriented programming.
    
- Often considered a superset of C (though not strictly true due to later C changes).
    

Standardization:

- 1998: First ISO C++ standard.
    
- 2003: Minor update (C++03).
    
- Major updates: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23.
    
- C++11 marked a significant expansion and is widely considered a modern baseline.
    
- New standards are expected roughly every three years.
    

Standards are commonly referred to by their publication year (e.g., C++20).

### Philosophy of C and C++

Core philosophy: “Trust the programmer.”

- Provides high control and flexibility.
    
- Does not prevent many incorrect or dangerous actions.
    
- Knowing common pitfalls is essential.

### What C++ Is Good At

C++ excels in performance-critical and resource-sensitive applications, including:

- Video games
    
- Real-time systems
    
- High-performance financial systems
    
- Graphical applications and simulations
    
- Productivity software
    
- Embedded systems
    
- Audio and video processing
    
- Artificial intelligence and neural networks
    

It also benefits from a large ecosystem of high-quality third-party libraries.

### Popularity and Relevance

- One of the most popular compiled languages.
    
- Frequently ranked among the top programming languages overall.
    
- Commonly taught in academic settings.
    
- Maintains regular updates and strong industry usage.

### Do You Need to Know C First?

No.  
You can learn C++ directly. After learning C++, learning standard C is relatively straightforward if needed.
