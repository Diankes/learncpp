# 1.3 — Introduction to objects and variables

# Data and values

In **1.1 — Statements and the structure of a program**, we learned:

- Programs are made of **statements**
- Statements are grouped into **functions**
- Functions execute statements sequentially

But what do these statements actually *work on*?

They work on **data**.

---

## What is data?

**Data** is any information that can be:

- moved
- processed
- stored

by a computer.

---

## Core idea

Programs are collections of instructions that **manipulate data** to produce a desired result.

---

Although programs themselves are technically data, we typically use:

- **Code** → the program itself
- **Data** → the information the program operates on

---

# Where does data come from?

A program can get data from:

- A file
- A database
- A network
- User input (keyboard, etc.)
- Hardcoded directly into the source code

Example from *Hello World*:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";
```

The text `"Hello world!"` was hardcoded into the program and printed.

---

# Values

A single piece of data is called a **value**.

Examples:

- Numbers → `5`, `-6.7`
- Characters → `'H'`, `'$'`
- Text → `"Hello"`, `"H"`

---

## Quoting rules

- **Single quotes `' '`** → character values
- **Double quotes `" "`** → text values
- **Numbers** → not quoted

```cpp
std::cout << 5;       // number
std::cout << -6.7;    // number
std::cout << 'H';     // character
std::cout << "Hello"; // text
```

If you forget quotes around characters or text, the compiler will try to interpret it as C++ code — which usually causes an error.

---

# Literals

Values written directly into source code are called **literals**.

```cpp
5
-6.7
'H'
"Hello"
```

Literals are:

- Simple
- Read-only
- Cannot be modified

If we want data that can change, we need something else.

---

# Random Access Memory (RAM)

When you run a program:

1. The operating system loads it into **RAM**
2. Hardcoded data is loaded
3. Extra RAM is reserved for runtime use

RAM stores:

- User input
- File data
- Network data
- Calculated results

---

## Mental model

Think of RAM as a long series of numbered boxes.

Each box can store a value.

In older languages, programmers accessed boxes directly:

> "Go get value from box 7532"

In C++, we don’t do that.

---

# Objects and variables

In C++, we access memory indirectly through an **object**.

An object:

- Represents a region of storage (RAM or register)
- Can hold a value
- Has properties

We don’t worry about:

- Where memory is
- How much exactly
- How it’s managed

The compiler handles that.

---

## Variable

When an object has a name, it’s called a **variable**.

---

### Key definitions

**Object** → region of storage that holds a value  
**Variable** → a named object  

Naming lets us refer to the object later.

---

# Variable definition

Before using a variable, we must define it.

Definition example:

```cpp
int x;
```

This tells the compiler:

- Create a variable named `x`
- Its type is `int`

After this line, `x` can be used in the program.

---

## Example program

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x; // define variable x
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Compile-time vs Runtime

### Compile-time

When compiling:

- Compiler records that `x` exists
- Knows its type
- Determines how much memory it needs

### Runtime

When running:

- Memory is allocated for `x`
- `x` now exists in actual storage

---

## Important concept

An object is created when storage has been allocated for it.

---

# Data types

A **data type** determines:

- What kind of value the object stores
- How much memory it needs
- How the value is interpreted

Example:

```cpp
int x;
```

`x` is an **integer variable**.

---

## What is an integer?

An integer is a number without a fractional part:

- `4`
- `27`
- `0`
- `-2`
- `-12`

Not integers:

- `3.14`
- `-6.7`

---

## Types are fixed

In C++:

- The type must be known at compile-time
- The type cannot change at runtime

An `int` can only store integers.

If you need decimals:

```cpp
double width;
```

---

C++ supports many built-in types and allows you to create your own custom types (we’ll do that later).

---

# Defining multiple variables

You can define multiple variables of the same type:

```cpp
int a, b;
```

Equivalent to:

```cpp
int a;
int b;
```

---

## Common mistakes

### ❌ Repeating the type

```cpp
int a, int b; // wrong
```

Correct:

```cpp
int a, b;
```

---

### ❌ Mixing types in one statement

```cpp
int a, double b; // wrong
```

Correct:

```cpp
int a;
double b;
```

---

## Best practice

Even though this is allowed:

```cpp
int a, b;
```

Prefer:

```cpp
int a; // stores first value
int b; // stores second value
```

It is:

- Clearer
- Easier to read
- Easier to document

---

# Summary

- Programs manipulate **data**
- A **value** is a single piece of data
- A **literal** is a value written directly in code
- RAM stores program data during execution
- An **object** stores a value in memory
- A **variable** is a named object
- Every variable has:
  - An identifier (name)
  - A type
  - A value
- Variables are created at runtime when memory is allocated
- The type determines what kind of data can be stored
