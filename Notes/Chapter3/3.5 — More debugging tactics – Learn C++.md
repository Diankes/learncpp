# 3.5 — More debugging tactics – Learn C++

### **1. Conditional Debugging (The Toggle Switch)**

Instead of deleting your `std::cerr` lines, you wrap them in preprocessor directives. This lets you turn debugging "on" or "off" for the entire program by changing one single line.

- **The Tactic:** Use `#ifdef`, `#define`, and `#endif`.
    
- **The Benefit:** You don’t have to keep adding and removing code. You just comment out the `#define` at the top, and the compiler ignores all the debug code.
    
- **The "Pro" Setup:** In a multi-file project, you put `#define ENABLE_DEBUG` in a single header file (e.g., `config.h`). Every `.cpp` file includes that header, so you can toggle debugging for the **entire project** from one spot.

### **2. Using a Logger**

A **logger** is a tool that writes your debug information to a separate file (a "log file") rather than the console screen.

- **Why it's better:**
    
    - **No Clutter:** Your program’s actual output (like a calculator result) isn't mixed up with debug messages.
        
    - **Persistence:** You can look at the log file after the program finishes.
        
    - **Remote Help:** If a friend has a bug on their computer, they can just email you the `Logfile.txt`.
        
- **Tools:**
    
    - **`std::clog`:** The built-in C++ stream for logging (similar to `std::cerr`).
        
    - **Third-party Loggers:** Libraries like **plog** or **spdlog** are much more powerful. They automatically add timestamps and let you set "levels" (e.g., only show errors, or show everything).

### **Comparison: Which one to use?**

|**Feature**|**Conditional (#ifdef)**|**Logging (Library)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Effort**|Low (built-in)|Medium (must install library)|
|**Clutter**|**High** (lots of `#ifdef` blocks)|**Low** (one-line log calls)|
|**Output**|Console screen|File on disk|
|**Flexibility**|Toggle On/Off|Multiple levels (Info, Debug, Error)|

### **A Note on `plog`**

The lesson highlights **plog** as a "header-only" library, meaning you don't have to go through a complex installation—you just download the files and tell your IDE where they are. It allows you to change `plog::debug` to `plog::none` to effectively "silence" the program without removing any code.
