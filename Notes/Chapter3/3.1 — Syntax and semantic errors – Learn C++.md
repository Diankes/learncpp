# # 3.1 — Syntax and semantic errors – Learn C++

Welcome to Chapter 3! Now that you know how to structure a program, it’s time to learn what to do when it inevitably breaks. Programming is as much about **debugging**—the art of finding and removing "bugs"—as it is about writing code.

Errors in C++ generally fall into two main buckets: **Syntax** and **Semantic**.

---

### **1. Syntax Errors**

A syntax error is like a "grammatical" mistake. You’ve written something that isn't valid C++.

- **Examples:** Missing semicolons (`;`), mismatched braces `{ }`, or naming a variable `1x` (variables can't start with numbers).
    
- **The Hero:** The **Compiler**. It will refuse to build your program and usually points right to the line where you messed up.
    
- **Difficulty:** Easy to fix because the compiler finds them for you.

### **2. Semantic Errors (Logic Errors)**

A semantic error is an error in **meaning**. Your code follows the C++ grammar rules perfectly, but it doesn't do what you actually intended.

These are split into two sub-categories:

#### **A. Compile-time Semantic Errors**

The compiler can still catch some logic errors if they violate fundamental language rules.

- **Example:** Trying to use a variable you never declared, or trying to return a "string" from a function that is supposed to return an `int`.
    

#### **B. Runtime Semantic Errors**

These are the "stealth" bugs. The program compiles fine, but things go wrong while it’s running.

- **Crashes:** Your program hits a wall and dies (e.g., **Division by zero**).
    
- **Silent Failures:** The program runs, but the output is wrong.
    
    - _Example:_ You wrote `x - y` inside an `add()` function.
        
    - _Example:_ You used an **uninitialized variable**, leading to random "garbage" numbers.
        
    - _Example:_ You put a `return` statement too early, so the rest of your code never runs (**unreachable code**).

### **Summary Comparison**

|**Error Type**|**Caught By**|**When?**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Syntax**|Compiler|During Build|`int x = 5` (missing semicolon)|
|**Semantic (Type/Declaration)**|Compiler|During Build|`int x = "Hello";`|
|**Semantic (Logic)**|**You** (via testing)|During Execution|`5 + 5` resulting in `0`|

> **Pro Tip:** Don't be discouraged by compiler errors! They are your friends. The bugs that _don't_ trigger a compiler error—the runtime semantic ones—are the ones that will keep you up at night.
