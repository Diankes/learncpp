# 0.12 — Choosing a language standard — Summary

There are many versions of C++:

- C++98
    
- C++03
    
- C++11
    
- C++14
    
- C++17
    
- C++20
    
- C++23
    
- C++26 (upcoming)
    

How does your compiler know which one to use?

Every compiler selects a **default language standard**.  
That default is often **not** the latest version. Many compilers still default to C++14.

If you want to use a different language standard (and you should), you must explicitly configure your compiler.

---

## Naming of language standards

Language standards are named after their publication year.

|Publication year|Conventional name|Development name|
|---|---|---|
|2011|C++11|C++0x|
|2014|C++14|C++1y|
|2017|C++17|C++1z|
|2020|C++20|C++2a|
|2024|C++23|C++2b|
|TBD|C++26|C++2c|

Development names are used while the standard is still in progress.

Example:  
C++11 was called C++0x because it was originally expected before 2010.

---

# Which language standard should you choose?

### In professional environments

It is common to use a standard that is **one or two versions behind the newest finalized version**.

Reasons:

- Compiler bugs have been resolved
    
- Best practices are well established
    
- Cross-platform support is more reliable
    

---

### While learning or for personal projects

Use the **latest finalized standard your compiler supports**.

There is very little downside, and you gain access to modern features.

---

## Author’s note (important for you)

LearnCpp primarily targets **C++17**.

However, since you are using **GCC 13**, you can safely use **C++23**, which is fully finalized.

Best recommendation for you:  
Use **C++23**.

---

# Setting the language standard (GCC / g++-13)

With GCC or Clang, you select a standard using:

```
-std=c++17
-std=c++20
-std=c++23
```

Since you are using `g++-13`, use:

```
-std=c++23
```

If you ever want experimental support for upcoming features, you can use:

```
-std=c++2c
```

But this is not recommended while learning.

---

# Final VS Code configuration (C++23 + strict mode)

Open your `tasks.json`.

Place the language standard flag **before** `"${file}"`.

This is your final, correct configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "cppbuild",
      "label": "C/C++: g++-13 build active file",
      "command": "/usr/bin/g++-13",
      "args": [
        "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
        "-g",
        "-std=c++23",
        "-pedantic-errors",
        "-Wall",
        "-Weffc++",
        "-Wextra",
        "-Wconversion",
        "-Wsign-conversion",
        "-Werror",
        "${file}",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
      },
      "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "detail": "Build active file using GCC 13 (C++23 strict mode)."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# Configure IntelliSense to match

Because you are using the Microsoft C/C++ Extension, IntelliSense must match your compiler standard.

In `c_cpp_properties.json`, ensure:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Linux",
      "includePath": ["${workspaceFolder}/**"],
      "defines": [],
      "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/g++-13",
      "cStandard": "c11",
      "cppStandard": "c++23",
      "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64"
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

This keeps the editor and compiler consistent.

---

# Important reminder

When changing your language standard:

- Apply it to all build configurations
    
- Ensure IntelliSense matches
    
- Rebuild your project
    

---

# If code won’t compile

If a feature does not compile:

1. Ensure you selected the correct language standard.
    
2. Ensure your compiler version supports that feature.
    
3. Verify with a small test program.
    
4. Upgrade your compiler if necessary.
    

Even finalized standards may have partial compiler support.

---

# Final recommended state for you

You are now configured to:

- Use `g++-13`
    
- Compile with **C++23**
    
- Enforce strict ISO compliance
    
- Enable full warnings
    
- Treat warnings as errors
    
- Keep IntelliSense aligned
    

This is the correct final setup for lesson 0.12.
