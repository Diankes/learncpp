# 2.x — Chapter 2 summary and quiz
### **1. The Anatomy of Functions**

Functions are the building blocks of C++.

- **Definitions:** The actual code (body) inside curly braces.
    
- **Calls:** The instruction to execute that code (don't forget the `()`!).
    
- **Return Values:** Non-void functions **must** return a value, which is passed back via **return by value**. `main()` returns a status code (0 = success).
    
- **Void Functions:** These do the work but return nothing. They cannot be used where a value is expected.
    

### **2. Parameters and Arguments**

- **Parameters:** The "placeholders" defined in the function header.
    
- **Arguments:** The actual "values" you pass into the function during a call.
    
- **Pass by Value:** C++ copies the argument's value into the parameter.
    

### **3. Scope vs. Lifetime**

These are two of the most important concepts to keep straight:

- **Scope (Compile-time):** Where a variable can be _seen_ and used.
    
- **Lifetime (Runtime):** When a variable is _alive_ (created and destroyed) in memory.
    
- **Local Variables:** Defined inside a function. They are created when the function starts and destroyed when it ends (out of scope).

### **4. The Multi-File Workflow**

To keep code manageable, we split it into multiple `.cpp` files.

- **Forward Declarations:** Telling the compiler a function exists elsewhere using a **function prototype** (header + semicolon).
    
- **Declarations vs. Definitions:** A declaration says "this exists"; a definition actually creates it. All definitions are declarations, but not all declarations are definitions.
    
- **Naming Collisions:** Solved by **Namespaces** (like `std::`), which ensure identifiers are unique.
    

### **5. The Preprocessor & Headers**

- **Preprocessor:** Runs before compilation to handle directives (starting with `#`).
    
- **Headers (`.h`):** Used to "propagate" declarations to multiple files.
    
- **Header Guards:** Prevents a file from being included twice in the same `.cpp` file (preventing redefinition errors).
    
- **Quotes vs. Brackets:** Use `< >` for system headers and `" "` for your own.

### **6. Design & Best Practices**

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** If you're writing the same code twice, put it in a function.
    
- **Refinement:** The quiz in this section showed a perfect evolution of a program:
    
    1. **Single File:** Quick and dirty.
        
    2. **Multiple Files:** Organized, but needs manual forward declarations.
        
    3. **Headers/Guards:** The "Pro" way—automated, safe, and scalable.
        

> **Linker Error Tip:** If you see "undefined reference," the compiler found the declaration (the promise), but the linker couldn't find the definition (the actual code). Usually, this means you forgot to add a `.cpp` file to your project!

**You've officially leveled up! Would you like to try a "Boss Fight" challenge where I give you a problem and you try to design the file structure (Headers and CPPs) for it from scratch?**
