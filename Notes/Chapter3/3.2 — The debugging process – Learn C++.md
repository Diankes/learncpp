# 3.2 — The debugging process – Learn C++
### **The 6-Step Debugging Cycle**

When a program compiles but produces the wrong result (a semantic error), you should follow these specific steps rather than just randomly changing code:

1. **Find the root cause:** Identify exactly which line of code is misbehaving. This is often the hardest part.
    
2. **Understand the issue:** Don’t just "fix it" until you understand _why_ it was broken. Blindly changing signs or variables often creates more bugs later.
    
3. **Determine the fix:** Evaluate your options. Should you rewrite the function, change a single operator, or refactor the whole logic?
    
4. **Repair the issue:** Actually apply the fix and recompile.
    
5. **Retest the fix:** Verify that the specific bug you found is now gone.
    
6. **Retest for regressions:** Ensure that your fix didn't accidentally break something else in the program.

### **The Ice Maker Analogy**

The lesson uses a great real-world analogy to separate **symptoms** from **root causes**:

- **The Symptom:** No ice comes out of the dispenser.
    
- **The Investigation:** You hear the motor, so the dispenser works. You look in the tray; it's empty.
    
- **The False Root Cause:** "The tray is empty" is just another symptom.
    
- **The Actual Root Cause:** The ice maker itself is broken.
    

In code, the "symptom" is usually a wrong number on your screen, but the "root cause" might be several functions deep in your logic.

### **Example: The "Add" Function Bug**

In the provided code example:

C++

```
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x - y; // The root cause: wrong operator
}
```

- **The Investigation:** You see `5 + 3 = 2`.
    
- **Deduction:** Since you passed in `5` and `3` directly (literals), the input is perfect. Therefore, the logic inside `add()` must be the failure point.
    
- **The Fix:** Changing `-` to `+` and retesting to confirm you get `8`.

### **Key Takeaway**

For small programs, the root cause is often obvious. For large programs, you can't just "eyeball" it. You need to verify your assumptions step-by-step until you find the exact line where the reality of the program differs from your mental model.

**Would you like to see the next lesson's "Strategies for Finding Root Causes," or should we try a quick exercise where I give you a "symptom" and you try to deduce the "root cause"?**
