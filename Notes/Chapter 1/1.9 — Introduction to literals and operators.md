# 1.9 — Introduction to literals and operators

This lesson introduces:

- What **literals** are
    
- How literals differ from variables
    
- What **operators** are
    
- Operator types (arity)
    
- Chaining, precedence, and side effects

# Literals

A **literal** (or literal constant) is a fixed value written directly in your source code.

Examples:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";
int x { 5 };
```

- `"Hello world!"` → string literal
    
- `5` → integer literal
    

---

## Literals vs Variables

Both literals and variables:

- Have a value
    
- Have a type
    

The difference:

- **Literal** → value is fixed and cannot change
    
- **Variable** → value is stored in memory and can change
    

Example:

```cpp
std::cout << 5 << '\n';  // prints literal directly

int x { 5 };
std::cout << x << '\n';  // prints value stored in memory
```

Why literals are constant:

- Literal values are compiled directly into the executable.
    
- Executables can’t change at runtime.
    
- Variables store values in memory, and memory can change.
    

---

## Key Insight

- **Literals** = direct values in code
    
- **Variables (objects)** = memory locations that store values
    

---

# Operators

An **operator** performs an operation on one or more values (called operands) and produces a result (called a return value).

Example:

```cpp
1 + 2
```

- `1` and `2` → operands
    
- `+` → operator
    
- `3` → return value
    

---

## Common operators

Arithmetic:

```
+   addition
-   subtraction
*   multiplication
/   division
```

Other operators:

```
=    assignment
<<   insertion (output)
>>   extraction (input)
==   equality comparison
```

Some operators are keywords:

```
new
delete
throw
```

Symbol operators are often written like:

```
operator+
operator>>
```

---

# Operator arity (number of operands)

Operators are categorized by how many operands they take.

---

## 1. Unary (1 operand)

Example:

```cpp
-5
```

- `-` flips the sign of 5
    

---

## 2. Binary (2 operands)

Example:

```cpp
3 + 4
```

- Left operand: 3
    
- Right operand: 4
    
- Result: 7
    

Most operators are binary (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `<<`, etc.)

---

## 3. Ternary (3 operands)

Only one in C++:

- The conditional operator (`?:`)
    

---

## 4. Nullary (0 operands)

Only one in C++:

- `throw`
    

---

## Operators can have multiple meanings

Example: `-`

Unary:

```cpp
-5
```

Binary:

```cpp
4 - 3
```

Context determines meaning.

---

# Chaining operators

Operators can be combined:

```cpp
2 * 3 + 4
```

Multiplication happens first:

```
2 * 3 → 6
6 + 4 → 10
```

---

## Order of operations (Precedence)

C++ follows normal math rules:

1. Parentheses
    
2. Exponents
    
3. Multiplication / Division
    
4. Addition / Subtraction
    

Often remembered as **PEMDAS**.

---

# Return values and side effects

Most operators:

- Compute and return a value
    

Example:

```cpp
2 + 3  // returns 5
```

---

## Side effects

A **side effect** is an observable change beyond returning a value.

Examples:

```cpp
x = 5;            // changes x
std::cout << 5;   // prints to console
```

Even though these operators return values, we mostly use them for their side effects.

Important:  
In C++, “side effect” just means an observable effect — not something bad.

---

## Why assignment and insertion can chain

Both return their left operand:

```cpp
x = 5        // returns x
std::cout << 5  // returns std::cout
```

This allows chaining:

```cpp
x = y = 5;
```

Evaluates as:

```
x = (y = 5)
```

And:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello " << "world!";
```

Evaluates left to right.

---

# Quiz recap

```cpp
std::cout << 3 + 4;        // 7
std::cout << 3 + 4 - 5;    // 2
std::cout << 2 + 3 * 4;    // 14 (multiplication first)
```

Extra:

```cpp
int x { 2 };
std::cout << (x = 5);
```

- Assigns 5 to x
    
- Returns x
    
- Prints 5

# Key takeaways

- Literals are fixed values written directly in code.
    
- Variables store values in memory and can change.
    
- Operators act on operands to produce return values.
    
- Operators can be unary, binary, ternary, or nullary.
    
- C++ follows normal math precedence.
    
- Some operators produce side effects.
    
- Assignment and insertion operators return their left operand to allow chaining.

You now understand the fundamental building blocks of expressions in C++:  
**values (literals & variables) + operators = computation.**
