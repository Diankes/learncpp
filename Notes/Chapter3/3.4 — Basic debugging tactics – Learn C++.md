# 3.4 — Basic debugging tactics – Learn C++

Manual debugging is like being a detective with limited tools—it’s a bit messy, but it gets the job done when you're just starting out. Here is a summary of the basic tactics used to hunt down bugs without fancy tools.

### **Tactic #1: Commenting Out Code**

If a program is acting up, you can "hide" sections of code to see if the bug persists.

* **If the bug disappears:** The code you just commented out is likely the culprit.
* **If the bug stays:** You’ve successfully ruled out that section.
* **Warning:** It’s easy to forget to uncomment code, which can create new bugs. **Version Control** (like Git) is your best friend here to track what you've changed.

### **Tactic #2: Validating Code Flow**

Sometimes the logic isn't wrong, but the program is calling functions in the wrong order or not at all.

* **The Method:** Place a print statement at the top of every function (e.g., `std::cerr << "getValue() called\n";`).
* **Why `std::cerr`?** Unlike `std::cout`, which is "buffered" (it waits to collect a bunch of text before printing), `std::cerr` is **unbuffered**. It prints *immediately*. This is crucial because if your program crashes, `std::cout` might "die" with the text still in its buffer, misleading you about where the crash happened.

### **Tactic #3: Printing Values**

This is the most common manual tactic: printing variables to see when a "good" value turns "bad."

* **Strategy:** Print values at every major step (input, calculation, output).
* **The "Aha!" Moment:** If a user enters `4`, but your debug log says `main::x = 3`, you know exactly where the logic failed—somewhere between the input and the assignment.

### **Practical Tips for "Print Debugging"**

| Tip | Why? |
| --- | --- |
| **Use `std::cerr**` | Immediate output; survives crashes better. |
| **Don't Indent Debug Lines** | Makes them visually "pop" out so you don't forget to delete them. |
| **Use `// clang-format off**` | Prevents your IDE from "fixing" your unindented debug lines. |
| **Label Your Output** | Instead of printing `4`, print `main::x = 4` so you know which variable you're looking at. |

### **The Downside of Manual Printing**

While effective, this approach has some significant flaws:

1. **Clutter:** It makes your beautiful code look like a mess.
2. **Maintenance:** You have to manually add and then manually remove every line.
3. **Risk:** You might accidentally delete a real line of code while cleaning up your debug statements.
