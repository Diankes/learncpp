# 1.x — Chapter 1 summary and quiz

# Core Concepts

### Statements

- A **statement** is an instruction that performs an action.
    
- Most end with a semicolon `;`.
    

---

### Functions

- A **function** is a sequence of statements that run in order.
    
- Every program must have:
    

```cpp
int main()
```

Execution starts in `main()`.

---

### Identifiers

Names for:

- Functions
    
- Variables
    
- Types
    
- Templates
    

Must follow C++ naming rules.

---

### Syntax

- **Syntax** = grammar rules of C++
    
- Breaking them → **syntax error**
    

---

### Comments

Two types:

```cpp
// Line comment

/* Block comment */
```

- Don’t nest block comments
    
- Can “comment out” code to disable it temporarily
    

---

# Data & Variables

### Data

Information the program processes:

- Numbers
    
- Characters
    
- Text
    

A single piece of data = **value**

---

### Variables

- Named memory storage
    
- Created with a **definition**
    
- Instantiated at runtime (given a memory address)
    

Example:

```cpp
int x{};
```

---

### Data Types

Define how data is interpreted.

Example:

- `int` → integer (no fractional part)
    

---

# Initialization vs Assignment

### Initialization

Giving a variable its first value at creation:

```cpp
int x{ 5 };
```

Happens **once**.

---

### Assignment

Changing value after creation:

```cpp
x = 10;
```

Can happen **many times**.

---

# Types of Initialization (6 forms)

|Type|Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Default|`int x;`|Often indeterminate|
|Copy|`int x = 5;`||
|Direct|`int x(5);`||
|Direct-list|`int x{5};`|No narrowing|
|Copy-list|`int x = {5};`|No narrowing|
|Value|`int x{};`|Usually zero-initializes|

### Best Practice

Prefer:

```cpp
int x{};
```

Brace (list) initialization is safest.

Prefer initialization over assignment.

---

# Input & Output

### Output

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello";
```

Uses:

- `<<` (insertion operator)
    

Newlines:

```cpp
std::endl   // newline + flush
'\n'        // newline only (preferred)
```

⚠️ Don’t use `/n`

---

### Input

```cpp
std::cin >> x;
```

Uses:

- `>>` (extraction operator)
    

---

# Uninitialized Variables

A variable without a value:

```cpp
int x;  // uninitialized
```

Using it → **Undefined Behavior**

---

# Undefined Behavior (UB)

Occurs when the language rules are violated (e.g., using uninitialized variables).

Consequences:

- Crash
    
- Wrong result
    
- Seemingly works
    
- Anything at all
    

UB is dangerous because it's unpredictable.

---

# Operators & Expressions

### Operators

Symbols that perform operations.

|Type|Example|
|---|---|
|Unary|`-x`|
|Binary|`x + y`|
|Ternary|`cond ? a : b`|
|Nullary|(rare)|

---

### Expression

Combination of:

- Variables
    
- Literals
    
- Operators
    
- Function calls
    

Produces a single value.

Example:

```cpp
x + 5
```

---

### Expression Statement

An expression with `;`

```cpp
x = 5;
```

---

# Literals

Fixed values in code:

```cpp
5
"Hello"
```

---

# Keywords

Reserved names in C++ (e.g., `int`, `return`, `if`).

Cannot use them as variable names.

---

# Development Best Practices

### Build Incrementally

Good workflow:

1. Write small piece
    
2. Compile
    
3. Fix errors
    
4. Test
    
5. Repeat
    

Do NOT write entire program first.

---

### First Drafts Are Messy

Normal process:

> Make it work → Then improve it

Clean up after:

- Remove debug code
    
- Improve formatting
    
- Add comments
    
- Follow best practices
    

---

# Quiz Review

---

## Q1 — Initialization vs Assignment

Initialization:

- Happens once
    
- At creation
    

Assignment:

- Happens anytime after creation
    
- Can occur many times
    

---

## Q2 — When does UB occur?

When code violates language rules.

Effects:

- Anything
    
- Completely unpredictable
    

---

## Q3 — Addition/Subtraction Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x{};
    std::cin >> x;

    std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
    int y{};
    std::cin >> y;

    std::cout << x << " + " << y << " is " << x + y << ".\n";
    std::cout << x << " - " << y << " is " << x - y << ".\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Key lessons reinforced:

- Brace initialization
    
- `std::cin` / `std::cout`
    
- Expressions inside output
    
- Incremental development
