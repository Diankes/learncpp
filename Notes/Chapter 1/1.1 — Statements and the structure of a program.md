# 1.1 — Statements and the structure of a program

## Chapter introduction

Welcome to the first primary chapter of these C++ tutorials.

In this chapter, we introduce the foundational elements that every C++ program relies on. Because there are many important concepts to cover, most will be introduced at a high level. The goal is to help you understand how basic C++ programs are constructed.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to write simple C++ programs on your own.

Later chapters will revisit these topics in much greater depth and build more advanced concepts on top of them.

# Statements

A **computer program** is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.

A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.

Statements are:

- The most common type of instruction in C++
    
- The smallest independent unit of computation
    
- Comparable to sentences in natural language
    

When we want a C++ program to do something, we write statements.

Most (but not all) C++ statements end with a **semicolon (`;`)**.

If you see a line ending in a semicolon, it is probably a statement.

In high-level languages such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine-level instructions.

---

## Types of statements (overview)

C++ has many kinds of statements, including:

- Declaration statements
    
- Expression statements
    
- Jump statements
    
- Compound statements
    
- Selection statements (conditionals)
    
- Iteration statements (loops)
    
- Try blocks
    

You will learn all of these throughout the course.

# Functions and the `main` function

In C++, statements are grouped into units called **functions**.

A **function** is a collection of statements that execute sequentially (from top to bottom).

Functions allow us to:

- Organize code
    
- Reuse code
    
- Break problems into manageable pieces
    

---

## Rule

Every C++ program must contain a special function named:

```
main
```

(all lowercase)

When the program runs:

- Execution begins inside `main`
    
- Statements inside `main` execute in order
    
- The program typically ends when `main` finishes
    

---

## Nomenclature

When discussing functions, it is common to write:

```
main()
```

The parentheses indicate we are referring to a function.

The name of a function (or variable, type, etc.) is called its **identifier**.

---

# Characters and text

A **character** is a single written symbol, such as:

```
a
2
$
=
```

When you press a key on your keyboard, a character is produced.

A sequence of characters is called **text** (or a **string** in programming contexts).

C++ programs are written in **plain text**.

Plain text:

- Contains only standard characters
    
- Has no formatting (no bold, no colors, etc.)
    

---

# Dissecting “Hello world!”

Let’s examine a simple program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```

---

## Line-by-line breakdown

### Line 1

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This is a **preprocessor directive**.

It tells the compiler to include the **iostream library**, which is part of the C++ Standard Library.

We need this to use:

```
std::cout
```

Without this line, the program would not compile.

---

### Line 3

```cpp
int main()
```

This defines the `main` function.

- `int` means the function returns an integer value.
    
- `main` is the required entry point of every C++ program.
    

---

### Lines 4 and 7

```cpp
{
}
```

These curly braces define the **function body**.

Everything inside them belongs to the `main` function.

---

### Line 5

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";
```

This is a statement.

`std::cout` is used to output text to the console.

The `<<` operator sends text to the output stream.

This line produces the visible output:

```
Hello world!
```

---

### Line 6

```cpp
return 0;
```

This is a **return statement**.

When the program finishes, it returns a value to the operating system.

Returning `0` means:

> The program executed successfully.

---

# Syntax and syntax errors

Every language has rules governing how valid sentences are formed. These rules are called **syntax**.

C++ also has syntax rules.

If your program violates these rules, the compiler produces a **syntax error** and stops compilation.

---

## Example: Missing semicolon

If we remove the semicolon:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!"
```

The compiler will produce an error such as:

```
error: expected ';' after expression
```

or

```
syntax error: missing ';' before 'return'
```

---

## Key insight

Compilers sometimes report the error on the line _after_ the real mistake.

If you cannot find the issue on the reported line:

→ Check the line above it.

# Summary

You have learned:

- A statement is an instruction that performs an action.
    
- Functions group statements together.
    
- Every C++ program must contain a `main` function.
    
- Programs are written in plain text.
    
- Syntax rules must be followed exactly.
    
- Missing semicolons cause syntax errors.
    
- Compilation only succeeds when all syntax errors are fixed.

# Quick review

**What is a statement?**  
An instruction that tells the computer to perform an action.

**What is a function?**  
A collection of statements executed sequentially.

**What function must every program have?**  
`main`

**What usually ends a statement?**  
A semicolon (`;`)

**What is a syntax error?**  
A violation of the C++ language rules that prevents compilation.
