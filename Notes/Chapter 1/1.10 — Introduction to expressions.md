# 1.10 — Introduction to expressions

This lesson explains:

- What an **expression** is
    
- How expressions are evaluated
    
- Expression statements
    
- Subexpressions and full expressions
    
- The difference between statements and expressions

# What is an expression?

An **expression** is:

> A non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value.

Examples:

```cpp
2
x
2 + 3
five()
(2 * 3) + 4
```

Each of these produces a value when evaluated.

---

## Evaluation

**Evaluation** is the process of computing the result of an expression.

The result is usually a **value**.

Examples:

```cpp
2            // evaluates to 2
"Hello"      // evaluates to "Hello"
x            // evaluates to the value stored in x
2 + 3        // evaluates to 5
five()       // evaluates to whatever five() returns
```

---

## Key insight

Wherever C++ expects a single value, you can provide an expression that produces a value.

Example:

```cpp
int b{ 2 + 3 };       // expression
int c{ five() };      // expression
int d{ b };           // expression
```

C++ evaluates the expression first, then uses the resulting value.

---

# Expressions vs Statements

Important distinction:

- **Expression** → produces a value
    
- **Statement** → performs an action
    

Expressions do **not** end with semicolons.  
Statements do.

Example:

```cpp
2 + 3        // expression
int x{ 2 };  // statement (contains expression)
```

---

# Expression statements

An **expression statement** is:

> An expression followed by a semicolon.

Example:

```cpp
x = 5;
```

- `x = 5` is an expression
    
- Adding `;` makes it a statement
    

When used as a statement, the expression’s result is discarded.

Example:

```cpp
2 * 3;  // valid but useless (result 6 is discarded)
```

Some compilers warn about useless expression statements.

---

# Expressions with side effects

Some expressions do more than return a value — they also have **side effects**.

Examples:

```cpp
x = 5;            // assigns 5 to x
x = 2 + 3;        // assigns 5 to x
std::cout << x;   // prints x
```

These:

- Produce a value
    
- Cause observable changes
    

---

# Subexpressions and full expressions

Example:

```cpp
x = 4 + 5;
```

### Subexpressions

Expressions used as operands:

- `x`
    
- `4 + 5`
    
- `4`
    
- `5`
    

### Full expression

An expression that is not a subexpression:

- `x = 4 + 5`
    

---

# Compound expressions

A **compound expression** contains multiple operators.

Example:

```cpp
x = 4 + 5;
```

Uses:

- `operator+`
    
- `operator=`
    

So it’s compound.

---

# Statements vs Expressions (clear distinction)

Statement:

```cpp
int x;
```

Declares a variable. No expression.

Statement containing an expression:

```cpp
int x = 5;
```

Expression statement:

```cpp
x = 5;
```

Function call statement:

```cpp
foo();
```

Output statement:

```cpp
std::cout << x;
```

---

# Example walkthrough

```cpp
std::cout << 2 + 3 << '\n';
```

- `2 + 3` → 5
    
- Prints 5
    

```cpp
int x{ 6 };
int y{ x - 2 };
```

- `x - 2` → 4
    
- `y = 4`
    

```cpp
int z{};
z = x;
```

- `z = 6`
    

```cpp
std::cout << z * x;
```

- `6 * 6` → 36
    

Final output:

```
5
4
36
```

# Key takeaways

- An expression computes a value.
    
- Evaluation is the act of computing that value.
    
- Expressions can include literals, variables, operators, and function calls.
    
- Expressions don’t end in semicolons — statements do.
    
- Expression statements are expressions followed by `;`.
    
- Subexpressions are expressions inside larger expressions.
    
- Compound expressions use multiple operators.
    
- Wherever C++ expects a value, you can use a value-producing expression.

Expressions are the core of computation in C++ — they turn values into new values.
