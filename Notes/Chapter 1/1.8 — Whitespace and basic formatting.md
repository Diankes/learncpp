# 1.8 — Whitespace and basic formatting

This lesson explains:

- What **whitespace** is
    
- When whitespace is required
    
- How whitespace affects quoted text
    
- How to format C++ code for readability
    
- Basic style guidelines and tools

# What is whitespace?

In C++, **whitespace** refers to:

- Spaces
    
- Tabs
    
- Newlines
    

It is used for:

1. Separating language elements
    
2. Formatting code
    
3. Inside quoted text (string literals)
    

C++ is **whitespace-independent**, meaning formatting doesn’t affect program behavior (except in specific cases).

---

# When whitespace is required

Some elements must be separated so the compiler can distinguish them.

Example:

```cpp
int x;    // correct
```

Invalid:

```cpp
intx;     // treated as an identifier, not "int x"
```

Another example:

```cpp
int main();   // correct
```

`int` and `main` must be separated.

---

## Newlines as separators

Single-line comments end at a newline:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello"; // comment
this is not part of the comment
```

Preprocessor directives must be on their own lines:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
```

---

# Whitespace inside quoted text

Inside strings, whitespace is preserved exactly:

```cpp
"Hello world!"
"Hello          world!"
```

These are different.

Newlines are not allowed inside string literals:

```cpp
"Hello
world"  // error
```

But adjacent string literals separated by whitespace are concatenated:

```cpp
"Hello "
"world!"
```

---

# Using whitespace for formatting

Since C++ ignores most whitespace, we use it to improve readability.

Hard to read:

```cpp
int main(){std::cout<<"Hello";return 0;}
```

Better:

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello";
    return 0;
}
```

Statements can be split across lines:

```cpp
std::cout
    << "Hello world";
```

---

# Basic formatting recommendations

## 1. Indentation

- Use **tabs or spaces** (both are fine)
    
- Recommended: **4 spaces per indent**
    
- Be consistent
    

---

## 2. Brace styles

Two common styles:

Same line:

```cpp
int main() {
    // code
}
```

Next line (used in this tutorial):

```cpp
int main()
{
    // code
}
```

The tutorial prefers the second for readability and easier brace matching.

---

## 3. Indent code inside braces

Each statement inside `{}` should be indented one level:

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello\n";
}
```

---

## 4. Keep lines short

Recommended maximum: **80 characters**

If too long, split them:

```cpp
std::cout << "This is a really long line "
    << "that continues here\n";
```

If splitting with operators, put the operator at the start of the next line:

```cpp
std::cout << 3 + 4
    + 5 + 6
    * 7;
```

---

## 5. Use alignment for readability

Bad:

```cpp
cost = 57;
pricePerItem = 24;
value = 5;
```

Better:

```cpp
cost          = 57;
pricePerItem  = 24;
value         = 5;
```

Same idea for aligning comments.

---

## 6. Separate logical blocks with blank lines

Avoid bunching everything together. Add spacing between conceptual sections.

---

# Consistency matters most

C++ allows any formatting style.

But:

- Choose a style.
    
- Use it consistently.
    
- If working in someone else’s project, follow their style.
    

Consistency is more important than personal preference.

---

# Automatic formatting tools

Modern IDEs can auto-format code.

Examples:

- Visual Studio → Format Document
    
- Code::Blocks → Format with AStyle
    
- External tool: `clang-format`
    

Using auto-formatting helps maintain consistency.

---

# Style guides

A **style guide** defines formatting rules and best practices for a team or project.

Common C++ style guides:

- C++ Core Guidelines
    
- Google C++ Style Guide
    
- LLVM Style Guide
    
- GCC/GNU Style Guide
    

The lesson favors the **C++ Core Guidelines**.

# Key takeaways

- Whitespace is mostly ignored by the compiler.
    
- Some whitespace is required to separate tokens.
    
- Strings preserve whitespace literally.
    
- Good formatting improves readability.
    
- Keep lines short (~80 chars).
    
- Indent consistently (4 spaces recommended).
    
- Follow the style of the existing project.
    
- Use automatic formatting tools when possible.
